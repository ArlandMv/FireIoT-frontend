## Realtime app to privatetly display data from IoT into a dashboard.

This project is an example to showcase the features of [Firebase](https://youtu.be/XHvWx1F3S4A) and show how anyone can set up their own infraestructure for IoT devices on the [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing).

- Create a CI workflow to test and merge your code
- Create a CD workflow to deploy tested code
- Create an authentication barrier (protected routes)
- Create permissions to only access owned data (RTDB security rules)
- Showcase realtime data in dashboard (create and test component)
